# Hellzone Tweaks

This is just a collection of some small features/fixes wanted on a private Minecraft server, and additionally serves to teach myself how to mod Minecraft.

Note that this is a bit of a 'Frankenstein' codebase in that I copied some code from other mods available here on Github and tweaked it to my liking. When there's something copied, you will see a link at the top pointing to the original repository.

## Features
- 'Potion of Haste' for mining efficiency.
    - Can be brewed with an Awkward Potion and an Amethyst Shard.
- 'Magma Sponge' that works similar to a normal sponge, except for lava.
    - Can be crafted with 8 Magma and 1 Sponge, with the Sponge in the middle.
    - Upon placing on/near lava, will absorb up to a certain amount and turn into a 'Hot Magma Sponge'.
    - Use an empty bucket on a 'Hot Magma Sponge' to get a bucket of lava until it runs dry and becomes a cold reusable 'Magma Sponge' again.
    - Retains amount lava after mining so this is useful for carrying large amounts of lava from A to B.
